1. Download node.js and atom from a web client.
	a. Atom is a text editor for cmd terminals and will give you access to the code.
	b. node.js is what allows the code to connect to the localhost server on our computers.

2. Open and run a cmd terminal and navigate to the pathway that houses the spotify playlist generator.
	a. Make sure that any files that are zipped/compressed are extracted for full performance

3. Once node.js is installed and you are in the proper pathway, type in the command 'node generator.js'
	a. This should get the application running and connected to localhost:8888.

4. Once the code is running, open a web browser and type localhost:8888 into the search bar at the top of the browser.
	a. This should navigate you to our application where it will ask for a spotify login.

5. After you have reached the browser page, use the following spotify account for a test account.
	a. Username/email: JJPSN.tester@gmail.com
	b. Password: towson2022

6. After logging in on our webpage and Spotify (so you can see the playlist being generated), continue to make the playlist!
